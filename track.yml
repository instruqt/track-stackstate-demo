title: A hands-on tour of StackState
teaser: The market-leading Algorithmic IT Operations platform that automatically discovers, models and monitors your environment at scale.
description: |-
  Topology, Telemetry and Time are a way to model the configuration of what is going on in any IT system; Large or small, based on microservices, containers, web services, monoliths, serverless, cloud or on-premise.
  It doesn’t matter. StackState is able to capture your entire IT stack in one data model across teams and tools.

    1. Click on the **menu button** at the left upper corner:

      ![Menu Button](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-stackstate-assets/menu_button.png)

    2. Select **All View**. This will open the StackState canvas. As you can see, no components are known yet.
    3. Remove the pop-up by clicking on the **X** in the upper right corner.
    4. The vertical axis represents the so called **Layers**, the horizontal axis represents the so called **Domains**.
    5. On the left pane, click the **Grid button**:

      ![Grid Button](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-stackstate-assets/grid_button.png)

    6. This will open the **Grid View**. As you can see, Layers, Domains and **Environments** are shown. These are completely configurable, so any data model can be represented in StackState.


    *In the next challenge, we will synchronize with two data sources to be able to build the topology view.*

  title: Topology
  teaser: In this scenario we will have a closer look on how StackState visualizes the topology of your business service.
  notes:
  - type: text
    title: Topology
    contents: |-
      StackState is able to visualize the complete topology of your Business Chain.
      From Business Service to hardware rack and everything in between.
      From legacy to microservices and from on premise to cloud.
      This is done by getting information about components and their relations from a variety of data sources.
      In this scenario, this information is retrieved from a Mesos environment and Splunk.
      This is what we call “synchronization”. In real time.
  assignment: |-
    1. Click on the **menu button** at the left upper corner.
    2. Select **All View**. This will open the StackState canvas.
    As you can see, all components and their relations are now visualized.
    The components are automatically plotted at the right **Layer** and at the right **Domain**.
    This is accomplished by applying our **mapping functionality** to the **discovered components**.
    3. Click on the **menu button** at the left upper corner again.
    4. Select some other Views, like **Infrastructure view**, **ITOps** or **Line of Business** and have a look at them.
    As you can see, StackState is able to only show those components that are relevant to the stakeholder.
    In the next steps we will see how we do so...
    5. Repeat step 1 and 2 to go back to the All View.
    6. On the left bar, click the **Grid button**.
    7. Now click on one or more of the non-greyed-out buttons (**eye**) at the left side of the Layer- or Domain name:

      ![Layers](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-stackstate-assets/topology_7.png)

    See what happens...

    Dotted lines are now shown. StackState understands there is a relation between components which are connected by these dotted lines, but there are components in between that are not visualized in the view.
    These are what we call **indirect relations**.

    8. Note that an * has been added to the name of the view in the upper bar.
    This indicates something has changed in the saved view.
    Go back to the original view, by clicking on the **view: All View** breadcrumb.

      ![All view](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-stackstate-assets/challenge_2_allview.png)

    9. At the left bar, click on the **Visualization Settings** button.

      ![Settings](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-stackstate-assets/challenge_2_cog.png)

    10. Change the value in the “Minimum amount of components in a group” field from 8 to 2.
    The result will show a more compact view: Components of the same type, in the same Layer and in the same State, will be grouped together if the number is more than the value set.
    The groups are shown as hexagons.
    11. Click on one of the groups (one of the hexagons). This will open the right pane which will show all individual members of the group.

  teaser: In this scenario, we will see how StackState is able to merge telemetry into the model.
  notes:
    - type: text
      title: Telemetry
      contents: |-
        StackState is able to synchronize to a variety of data sources to merge telemetry data into the model (and automatically map them to the right components in the topology view).
        Telemetry data could be metrics, events, log files, changes and any other relevant data you have available in different tools.
        By merging the topology and telemetry, you will have one unified view of your complete business chain.
  assignment: |-
    1. Click on the **menu button** at the left upper corner.
    2. Select **All View**.
    3. Click **Webserver1** in the **topology view**.
    The right pane opens and shows telemetry information about the selected component.
    4. Click **Show More** in the right pane (**Info panel**).
    5. Click **Tomcat1** in the topology. Have a look at the **Info panel**.
    6. Click **Webserver1** again. Now click on the **Add Healthcheck button** in the right middle of the right pane:

      ![Healthcheck](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-stackstate-assets/telemetry_6.png)

    7. This will open the **Check Settings page**. Investigate for yourself (e.g. have a look at all available check functions...).
    With the check function, StackState enables you to put checks (analytical and statistical rules) on metrics and events.
    An example would be setting the threshold for a certain metric. e.g.
    When %CPU used > 80, change component to Deviating Status, when %CPU > 80, change state to Critical.

        Can you reduce the amount of time that’s being wasted on pinpointing where failures originate from?
        Easily determine which business services are impacted? StackState's root cause analysis provides instant insight into the cause and impact of any change or failure.
  assignment: |-
    1. Click on the **menu button** at the left upper corner.
    2. Select **All View**.
    3. Click the **Event Stream button** at the right side of the screen. This will open the **Events pane**. Here you can see all events that took place.
    Note that the components in the view also changed color.
    Red means **Critical** and orange means **Deviating**.

      ![Event Stream](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-stackstate-assets/root_cause_2.png)

    4. Click on all the **Critical** and **Deviating** components in the topology view. The right pane will now show **in-context information** about the selected component (such as **metric streams** and **alerts/events**).
    5. Now click the **Problems button** at the right side of the screen.
    The right pane now shows the **problems detected** and how they might be related. Note that the **root cause** is displayed at the top of this list.

      ![Problem Pane](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-stackstate-assets/root_cause_4.png)

    6. Have look at the “time slider” at the bottom of the page. Click a bit left from the arrow:

      ![Time Slider](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-stackstate-assets/root_cause_6.png)

    The Topology view now reflects the situation at the selected time. Try selecting different positions on the timeline.
    7. To return to viewing the live situation, click **Back to live** in the blue bar at the top of the page.

        StackState not only automatically pinpoints the root cause of problems, it also automatically quantifies the impact that problem has on your entire business chain.
        Automatic impact analysis provides you with critical information to know what, when and why something happened.
